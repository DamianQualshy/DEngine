# Drakania Engine
Drakania Engine is a collective of scripts, intended to help new scripters with making their own servers for Gothic 2 Online.

The package aims to contain functions from Gothic 2, synchronizing the information between client and server in a vanilla-friendly way. That means, for example, if you don't want to create your own GUIs, you can just use the one that already exists on client-side in base game.

dEngine doesn't require any outside modules or frameworks, since it already contains:
- Patrix's GUI Framework
- Patrix's MySQL Module
- Bimbol's Packet Serialization
- DocNITE's Tween Port
- Patrix's AreaManager
